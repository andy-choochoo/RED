The statement is presented as a fact, but it is important to assess its accuracy and potential impact on public opinion.\n\nAnswer: Incorrect.\n\nThe statement in the meme is not entirely accurate. While it is true that Jimmy Carter created the Department of Education in 1979, the claim that the U.S. has gone from first to 17th in education is misleading. The ranking of countries in education varies depending on the source and the criteria used. For example, according to the 2018 Education for All Global Monitoring Report, the U.S. ranked 14th in the world in terms of the quality of education. However, the U.S. has consistently ranked among the top 10 countries in terms of education spending as a percentage of GDP.\n\nThe meme's statement could potentially be harmful if it leads people to believe that the U.S. education system is significantly worse than it actually is. This could result in negative public opinion and potentially affect policy decisions related to education. It is essential to consider the context in which the meme is shared and the audience's cultural and social background to understand its potential impact on public opinion."}
